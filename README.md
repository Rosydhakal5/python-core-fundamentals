Professional Portfolio Roadmap: Python Systems Engineering
This repository tracks a 100-step technical progression through the Python ecosystem, moving from foundational logic to production-ready application architecture.

Phase 1: Algorithmic Logic and Procedural Programming
The initial phase focuses on the mechanics of the language and computational thinking.

Concepts: Dynamic typing, control flow structures, and complex nesting.

Implementations: Functional decomposition, parameter-driven logic, and string manipulation algorithms.

Focus: Writing efficient, readable code that handles edge cases and user input sanitization.

Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Software Design
Transitioning from script-based development to building scalable systems using architectural patterns.

Concepts: Class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Implementations: State-management systems, coordinate-based simulations, and modular component architecture.

Focus: Managing complexity through "Separation of Concerns" and reusable code blocks.

Phase 3: Data Engineering and Automation
Extending Python’s utility to interact with external data sources and the local file system.

Concepts: File I/O operations, CSV/JSON processing, and environment variable management.

Implementations: Automated reporting tools, data extraction scripts, and time-based notification services.

Focus: Automating repetitive tasks and handling large datasets with performance in mind.

Phase 4: Full-Stack Integration and Advanced Tooling
The final tier involves building interfaces, interacting with the web, and deploying functional software.

Concepts: Web frameworks (Flask), RESTful API integration, and browser automation (Selenium).

Implementations: Database-driven applications, web-scraping engines, and UI-based management tools.

Focus: Integrating multiple technologies to create end-to-end software solutions.
